## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Grab and Move:** Click & drag objects around the scene.  
2. **Transform & Fix:** Rotate, resize, or snap items into place.  
3. **Dynamic World:** Animated clouds, vehicles, and ambient effects bring the map to life.  
4. **Win Condition:** Once all pieces are correctly placed, the game triggers the *Victory Event*!  
5. **Camera Control:** Scroll or pinch to zoom; the camera stays within set bounds.
